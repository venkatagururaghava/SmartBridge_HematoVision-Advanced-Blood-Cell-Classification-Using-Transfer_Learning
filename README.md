HematoVision: AI-Powered Blood Cell Classification

INTRODUCTION:

Project Overview : HematoVision is a deep learning project designed to accurately and efficiently classify blood cells from microscopic images. Utilizing a dataset of over 12,000 images, this project leverages transfer learning with the VGG16 architecture to distinguish between four major types of white blood cells: eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils. Purpose : The final output is a fully functional web application built with Flask, where users can upload a blood cell image and receive an instant classification from the trained AI model. This project serves as a demonstration for real-world applications in healthcare, such as automated diagnostics, remote medical consultations, and medical training tools.
